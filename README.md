# My Links

Inspired by Linktree and others, but you should be able to control your page for free. Just getting started and will add more notes soon. 

## Commands

These commands assume you're in a unix environment, but they should work anywhere `npx`/`npm` is available.

### Develop

```sh
$ npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

### Build

```sh
$ npx @11ty/eleventy
```
